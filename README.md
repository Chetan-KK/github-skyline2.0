# GitHub Skyline 2.0 📈

Bringing back GitHub's loved Skyline feature for personalized data visualizations 🌄

GitHub unfortunately discontinued their awesome Skyline feature in 2022, which provided interactive visualizations of users' GitHub profiles and activity. 

We missed this feature so much that we decided to recreate GitHub Skyline 2.0! 🥳
